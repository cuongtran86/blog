This Blog Application is about to contain these functions:
+ User sign-in/out (JWT for authentication) and Register 
+ Blog CRUD (use React Quill for editor)
+ Blog suggestion 
+ Fulltext Search
+ File upload for blog image

The front-end project is finished but the back-end.
My idea for back-end is RestAPI connected with Oracle DB. 
First step, I made a default function to connect and execute SQL => passed and return data.
After that I tried to implement NodeJS code for users registration => the problem showed up.
I can't execute the SQL with the connection. (The problem is about my code, it's not right)
I'm stuck at this stage and I'm still finding the solution.
Hope to find a way to resolve this problem ASAP.

Good to hear your advice about this.
