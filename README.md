This Blog Application about to contain these functions:
+ User sign-in/out (JWT for authentication) and Register
+ Blog CRUD (use React Quill for editor)
+ Blog suggestion 
+ Fulltext Search
+ File upload for blog image

The front-end project is finished but the back-end.
My idea for back-end is RestAPI connected with Oracle DB. 
First step, I made a default function to connect and execute SQL => passed and return data.
After that I tried to implement NodeJS code for users registration => the problem showed up.
I cant execute the SQL with the connection. (The problem is about my code, it's not right)
Im stuck at this stage and Im still finding the solution.
Hope to find out a way resolve this one ASAP.
